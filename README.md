## Summarry 
This is a project done in NextJs with the use of framer-motion to create a beautiful concept landing page for an abstract company. The learning is a part of a tutorial from javascript Mastery youtube channel. I loved replicating the work. Hope you like the replica... though completely the same it is not copy pasted but remade. I think the best way to learn is by being doing as many times as possible and now am at my many times point. See you next time.
## Video Representation
So, The video is too big but you can always download the repo and run it yourself. Here are some images though:
